# Blackboard

Using text files under the hood, Blackboard aims to be a minimalistic task management app that focuses on what feels natural.
If you find yourself needing a place to quickly jot down things that need to be done, as well as keep track of what order you should do them in, this is probably the tool for you.

Blackboard is opinionated and doesn't try to be something that it isn't:
- No task priorities
- No due dates
- No urgency flags

When used in conjunction with a more elaborate task management system such as Jira, Trello, Asana or ClickUp (to name a few), this satisfies that gap in between: where tasks aren't quite within scope of those boards, but still need to get done.

## Highlights

- Add tasks to your list, at any position
- Bump tasks to the top of your list
- Slump tasks to the bottom of your list
- Move tasks to specific positions
- Remove tasks from the list when completed
- Wipe all tasks

## Installation

TBD - Likely to be on npm

As a hobby project for learning Go, I am almost certain that there will be plenty of ways to make efficiency improvements, or tidy things up.
